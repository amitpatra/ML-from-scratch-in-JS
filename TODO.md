# things to do for our existing codebase:-

## Priority Level 1
* implement what you want to understand a concept... upto variational methods
* write a really short summery of each method.


## Priority Level 2
* read design patters.
* test all the code and make sure its working.
* create tests for all the code.
* make sure it follows google code-style
* make 2 versions, one for the understandable code (without tensor tricks ) which will be slow.


## Priority Level 3
* port everything to D3
* remove the dependence on ndjs entirely.
* make everything in typerscript if needed
