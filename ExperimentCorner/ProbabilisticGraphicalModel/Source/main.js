 * TODO Factor Graphs and inference:
 * * create a simple interface for formulating a graph ( directed or undirected)
 * * create a function which converts the directed into an undirected graph
 * * create a d-seperation function which converts ann undirected graph into d-seperated graph.
 * * create a function that converts undirected graph into factor graph.
 * * use this factor graph to run inference algorithms
 * * implement sum product function to perform exact inference on the given singly connected factor graph.
 * * implement junction-tree algorithm to perform approximate inference on the graphs with loops.
